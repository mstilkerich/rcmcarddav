	* Added: Basic validation and repair methods for broken input data.
	* Fixed: RecurrenceIterator could infinitely loop when an INTERVAL of 0
	  was specified.
	* Added: A cli script that can validate and automatically repair vcards
	  and iCalendar objects.
	* Added: A new 'Compound' property, that can automatically split up parts
	  for properties such as N, ADR, ORG and CATEGORIES.
	* Added: Splitter classes, that can split up large objects (such as exports)
	  into individual objects (thanks @DominikTO and @armin-hackmann).
	* Added: VFREEBUSY component, which allows easily checking wether
	  timeslots are available.
	* Added: The Reader class now has a 'FORGIVING' option, which allows it to

	  just allows underscores).

	  disregard any invalid lines.
	* Fixed: A bug in Windows timezone-id mappings for times created in
	  Greenlands timezone (sorry Greenlanders! I do care!).

	* Fixed: Parser is at least 25% faster with real-world data.

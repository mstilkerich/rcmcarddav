SabreTooth VObject library
==========================

The VObject library allows you to easily parse and manipulate [iCalendar](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)
and [vCard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350) objects using PHP.
The goal of the VObject library is to create a very complete library, with an easy to use API.

This project is a spin-off from [SabreDAV](http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/), where it has
been used for several years. The VObject library has 100% unittest coverage.

Installation

VObject requires PHP 5.3, and should be installed using composer.
The general composer instructions can be found on the [composer website](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md composer website).

After that, just declare the vobject dependency as follows:

```
"require" : {
    "sabre/vobject" : "2.0.*"
}
```

Then, run `composer.phar update` and you should be good.
